# This module depends on the Doxygen .tag file for libstdc++.
#
# If libstdc++ in the base system was built with documentation enabled,
# we can get this file from the base system.
#
# mm-common's build system provides the option of download the file, in
# case it's not available in the base system. At time of writing this
# comment, the build system fetched the file from here:
#
#   http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/libstdc++/latest-doxygen/libstdc++.tag
#
# BuildStream requires that all downloads are done outside the sandbox.
# In theory we could inject the remote file into the sandbox but BuildStream
# currently lacks an appropriate source plugin:
