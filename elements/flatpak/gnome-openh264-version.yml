# freedesktop-sdk has an openh264-version variable, but we may wish to use a
# newer version of the OpenH264 extension than freedesktop-sdk. This allows us
# use newer versions of OpenH264 for the GNOME master runtime than we do for
# stable runtimes, which is important because OpenH264 updates are risky.
gnome-openh264-version: '2.4.1'
