  # sysprof-capture-4 ends up in Requires.private
  # so we either could have added sysprof-minimal
  # as a builddep to everything that depends on it
  # and its downstream users, or make it a runtime
  # dependency of glib and have it be always available
  # transiently.
  #
  # Ideally, sysprof-minimal would be just a build dep
  # of modules, since its already statically linked.
