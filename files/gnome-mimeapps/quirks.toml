# GNOME Disks is undergoing a large rewrite, and the last stable release was 46.1. During
# the GNOME 47 development cycle, Disks dropped their gnome-disk-image-writer.desktop file
# and everything was consolidated into a unified mount/write dialog under the existing
# gnome-disk-image-mounter.desktop. However, a 47 release never came!
#
# The problem is that GNOME OS Nightly ships the latest tip of the main branch, which would
# normally become the next stable release. But since the stable release never happened, we have
# to downgrade back to Disks 46.1 for GNOME's stable branches. We don't capture this downgrade
# in GNOME's upstream mimeapps.list file. Thus: once we downgrade GNOME Disks, this re-introduces
# gnome-disk-image-writer.desktop, and we fail to account for that in the mimeapps.list we ship.
#
# This quirk solves the problem by manually making a config that works right for both Disks 46.1
# (shipped by most every distro) and Disks git main (shipped by GNOME OS Nightly). It should be
# dropped once there's a Disks release > 46.x
