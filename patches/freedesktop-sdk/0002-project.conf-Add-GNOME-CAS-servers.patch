Subject: [PATCH 2/6] project.conf: Add GNOME CAS servers

This is meant as a downstream patch. Till now everyone
has to configure the servers in their buildstream config,
and in order to have this work ootb we need to patch
the project.conf of fdo-sdk in order for the junction
to also make use of the CAS server.
